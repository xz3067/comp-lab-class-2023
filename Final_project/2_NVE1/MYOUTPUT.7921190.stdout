GROMACS reminds you: "I went to Venice and looked at the paintings of Canaletto to understand how he presented perspective, and it turned out it was an exponential law. If I had published this, maybe there would be a Karplus law in art theory as well as the Karplus equation in NMR" (Martin Karplus, Nobel lecture 2013)

NOTE 2 [file nve.mdp]:
  NVE simulation: will use the initial temperature of 301.859 K for
  determining the Verlet buffer size


NOTE 3 [file nve.mdp]:
  You are using a Verlet buffer tolerance of 5e-06 kJ/mol/ps for an NVE
  simulation of length 20000 ps, which can give a final drift of 2%. For
  conserving energy to 1% when using constraints, you might need to set
  verlet-buffer-tolerance to 2.5e-06.

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.16

NOTE 4 [file nve.mdp]:
  This run will generate roughly 618321 Mb of data
